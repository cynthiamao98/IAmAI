# CGUI-Lab-Summer-2018-
The i in AI is an interactive and participatory multimedia project that seeks to illuminate the critical role that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) have assumed in our lives, as we progressively rely on intelligent machines to guide and mediate our senses. The project will include a physical and trackable installation consisting of two pedestals, adorned with 3D-printed miniature furniture and other trackable objects. Using AR headsets and smartphones, the audience will see these installations come to life with two AI-enabled miniature avatars. The project rethinks the separability of machines and their creators by deciphering, mimicking, and creating two sets of moral codes that define our sense of self in relation to the (augmented and mediated) spaces we occupy and the bodies we inhabit. The project intends to unsettle the presumptive purity of computer code, serving as a reminder of the very human presence, the creators, responsible for the coded texts.
